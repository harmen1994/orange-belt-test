## user stories

❒ Set up project with local pre-commit, working Github actions pipeline and tests running.
❒ Have increased code readability by only allowing useful comments, making sure there's no dead code, magic strings and numbers are not there and all variables and methods are scoped.
❒ Have reduced code complexity by cleaning up long methods and clearing out duplicated code.
❒ Have more understandable code by making sure each code block has their own responsibility. By making classes small enough and tackling feature envy, inapprovipate intimacy, data classes and message chains.
❒ Make the code clearer by introducing the right amount of abstractions, correcitng long parameter lists, data clumbs, primitive obsession and middle man issues.
