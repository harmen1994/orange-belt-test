## 🍅 Pomodoro 1

✅ Set up the base project via Cookiecutter, enabling pre-commit, pipeline and documentation
✅ ⛌ During initial set-up Husky went off, stating that I should fix prettier linting, this is why the second commit is not the 'exact' code base

## 🍅 Pomodoro 2
✅ Removed dead code, comments
✅ made enum of parsedStartingPosition keys in array

## 🍅 Pomodoro 3
- note: starting with inline technical debt instead of TECHDEBT.md
- note: really hate prettier default settings regarding line length, it makes code spaghetti
✅ renamed variables in go function
✅ Added Instruction enum and renamed variables
✅ Added Direction enum
✅ Finished fist refactor stage

## 🍅 Pomodoro 4

🚧 long method called go()

## 🍅 Pomodoro 5
✅ long method called go()
-- ✅ also work further on the moveToCurrentDirection() function
